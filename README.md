Defination and uses of the static function in php and other languages

#Warning
######In PHP 7, calling non-static methods statically is deprecated, and will generate an `E_DEPRECATED` warning. Support for calling non-static methods statically may be removed in the future.

1. Because static methods are callable without an instance of the object created, the pseudo-variable $this is not available inside the method declared as static.
